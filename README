SYNOPSIS

    In your Build.PL:

     use Alien::FFI;
     use Module::Build;
     
     my $build = Module::Build->new(
       ...
       extra_compiler_flags => Alien::FFI->cflags,
       extra_linker_flags   => Alien::FFI->libs,
       ...

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution installs libffi so that it can be used by other Perl
    distributions. If already installed for your operating system, and it
    can be found, this distribution will use the libffi that comes with
    your operating system, otherwise it will download it from the Internet,
    build and install it for you.
