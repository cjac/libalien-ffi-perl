Description: Build and make available libffi
 This distribution installs libffi so that it can be used by other Perl
 distributions. If already installed for your operating system, and it can be
 found, this distribution will use the libffi that comes with your operating
 system, otherwise it will download it from the Internet, build and install it
 for you.
